  </strong><br /><br />

  The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did
  not find a current representation for the target resource or is not
  willing to disclose that one exists.  A 404 status code does not
  indicate whether this lack of representation is temporary or
  permanent; the 410 (Gone) status code is preferred over 404 if the
  origin server knows, presumably through some configurable means, that
  the condition is likely to be permanent.
